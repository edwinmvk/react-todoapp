## Introduction

ToDo App is a simple web application built with React and TypeScript that allows users to create and manage tasks. The build tool used is [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). [FluentUI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/get-started) and [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/docs/) are used for component library and styling respectively. This repository contains the source code for the app.
